Usage
-------

```
{exp:channel:entries channel="news"}
        {exp:vmg_nested:channel:entries channel="blog" prefix="blog"}
                {blog:title}
                {blog:entry_id}
                {blog:count}
                
                {if blog:no_results}{redirect="404"}{/if}

                module tag can be used. --}
